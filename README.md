Simler-Williamson, Metz, Frangioso, and Rizzo 2020.

## Relevant abbreviations:
- UMCA = bay laurel, Umbellularia californica
- LIDE = tanoak, Notholithocarpus densiflorus (previous genus = Lithocarpus)
- QUAG = coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia
- 06/2006/0607 = data collected in the 2006-07 surveys
- 2010/10 = data collected in the 2010-11 surveys
- 2013/14 = data collected in the 2013-14 surveys
- BA = basal area
- DBH = diameter at breast height
- Pr = Phytopthora ramorum

## Variable descriptions:
- Big Sur Plot or "Plot" = plot identification number
- Forest Alliance Type = index for Redwood forest (2) or Mixed Evergreen forest (1)
- tmax = mean 30 year dry-season maximum temperature, derived from PRISM
- totalfire = # of fires experienced between 1950 and 2010.
- totalfire.nb = # of fires experienced since 1950, excluding the Basin complex fire (which occurred before 2006-2007 sampling points)
- burned1950 = whether or not a plot has burned since 1950
- burned1950.08 = whether or not a plot has burned since 1950, excluding the 2008 Basin Complex fire
- LiveBA0607 = total live woody plant basal area in cm^2 (for stems >1cm dbh) in 2006-2007 samples
- LiveBA10 = total live woody plant basal area in cm^2 (for stems >1cm dbh) in 2010-11 samples
- Hosts06 = total host tree basal area in cm^2 (LIDE, Quercus sp, and UMCA stems >1cm dbh) in 2006-2007
- UMCAnonzero = presence/absence of bay laurel at plot level in 2006-2007 samples
- LIDEnonzero = presence/absence of tanoak at plot level in 2006-2007 samples
- UMCA.BA.LIVE.0607 = total bay laurel basal area in cm^2 in 2006-07 samples
- LIDE.BA.LIVE.0607 = total tanoak basal area in cm^2 in 2006-07 samples
- UMCA.BA.LIVE.13 / LIDE.BA.LIVE.13 = same as above, but for 2013-14 surveys
- tothost10/tothost13 = number of hosts present in 2010/11 or 2013/14 surveys (count)
- Burned_2008 = binary, whether plot burned in 2008 Basin Complex/Chalk fires
- UMCAnew, LIDEnew = new resprouting basal area for bay laurel and tanoak from after the 2008 fires
- LIDEsurvived, UMCAsurvived = basal area of tanoak or bay laurel that survived the 2008 fires
- hostpresent13 = binary, plot contains at least 1 host in 2013-14
- hostmortality.pr = basal area of susceptible hosts that have died in infested plots (not associated with fire-related mortality)
